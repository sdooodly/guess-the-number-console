# Guess the Number Console Game

Console-based "Guess the Number" game to learn basic C# syntax

* Basic program structure (`using`, `namespace`, `class`, `Main` method)
* Variables and data types (`int`, `string`, `bool`)
* Generating random numbers (`Random` class)
* User input and output (`Console.WriteLine`, `Console.ReadLine`, `int.TryParse`)
* Control flow (`while` loop, `if`/`else if`/`else` statements)
* Basic arithmetic and comparison operators

## How to Run

1.  **Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed.** If you don't have it, you can download and install it from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

2.  **Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.** If you've cloned this repository, the project files will be in a directory named `guess-the-number-console`.

3.  **Change your current directory to the `src` folder** within the project directory. You can do this using the `cd` command:

    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

4.  **Run the game using the .NET CLI (Command Line Interface):**

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    This command will build and execute the C# code.
